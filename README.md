# Binary Classification (Blak vs Hog) Using CNN

This project demonstrates a binary classification task using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). CNNs are widely used in machine learning for image recognition and classification tasks. This repository provides a practical example of how to implement and train a CNN for binary classification(blank vs hog).

## Features
  - Implementation of a CNN architecture for binary classification.
- Training and evaluation of the model using a dataset.
 - Visualization of training metrics such as accuracy and loss.
  - Easy-to-understand code written in Jupyter Notebook.

## Comparing Shallow NN and CNN :
key findings :
  - Shallow NN's first layer takes the flatten image's number as input which can be huge but CNN preprocess the images based on it's color channel and the feature like maxpooling reduces the dimensionality of image
  - the training loss was so high in Shallow NN in first epoch whereas CNN has comparatibly low
  - the time consument of Shallow NN is relatively high
